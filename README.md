# CS-305

1. During this project, I worked with Artemis Financial to identify and address security vulnerabilities in their web application. The company places a strong emphasis on secure communication to protect customer information from cyber-attacks and maintain compliance with government regulations.

2. Through manual review and static testing, I identified vulnerabilities in the DocData.java and CRUDController.java files that could potentially allow unauthorized access to sensitive information.

3. To increase the application's security, I recommended creating strong and unique data access username and password combinations, implementing secure coding practices during code review and modification, and updating the Apache Server to a newer version. Additionally, proper certificate validation will help prevent exploitation of vulnerabilities.

4. Overall, this project demonstrated the importance of secure coding practices and the value of software security in protecting a company's reputation and customer trust. In the future, I plan to continue using the tools and resources I used during this project to assess vulnerabilities and ensure the security of my software applications.
